<h2><b>World Cup 2019, Afghanistan vs Australia (Afg vs Aus) </b></h2>
<pre>
World Cup 2019, Afghanistan vs Australia (Afg vs Aus) Live Cricket Score Streaming Online: David Warner and Aaron Finch got the chase in their match against Afghanistan in Bristol on Saturday off to a great start. Hamid Hassan was the most impressive Afghan bowler on display early on, but the chase was always on at well above the required run rate. Aaron Finch (66) holed out in the deep to Gulbadin Naib in the 17th over, but by then Australia were well on course for victory.

Earlier, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins gave Australia the perfect start. Afghanistan lost both their openers very early. Starc bowled Mohammad Shahzad for a duck and Cummins got Hazratullah Zazai caught behind for a duck. Rahmat Shah (43) and Hashmatullah Shahidi (18) rebuilt the Afghanistan innings after those early blows. Zampa struck in his first over to break the partnership, getting Shahidiâ€™s wicket. Rahmat Shah, who was looking set for a big score, fell to a brilliant diving catch by Steve Smith. Smithâ€™s throw also ran out Mohammad Nabi (7) soon after, as Afghanistan lost their fifth wicket. Gulbadin Naib (31) and Najibullah Zadran (51) put on a 83-run sixth wicket partnership. Rashid Khan (27) came up with an entertaining cameo to take the Afghanistan total beyond 200. Their innings wrapped up in the 39th over, at a score of 207. This is the highest total by an Asian side at this World Cup so far.

The World Cup 2019 match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka will be livestreamed on Hotstar and broadcast on Star Sports.

Fifty for Warner

Warner brings up his 18th ODI fifty and his second World Cup fifty. What a return to international cricket! Some boos and lots of cheers heard around the ground. Khawaja doing well to complement him in this partnership.

Warner moves to 39

Warner was content to play second fiddle as long as Finch was taking the initiative. Upping his ante now.

 Both are such terrific players - Warner and Virat.. and the one common quality that really comes through when they are batting is the intensity. Always 100%. No matter the opposition, the stage.

First wicket

Afghanistan skipper Naib gets the wicket of Australia skipper Finch. Finch goes for 66, caught by Mujeeb ur Rahman in the deep. Looks disappointed as he walks off, but surely he has done enough for today. Usman Khawaja has come in at No. 3.
