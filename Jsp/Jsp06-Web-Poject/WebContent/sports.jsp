World Cup 2019, Afghanistan vs Australia (Afg vs Aus) Live Cricket Score 
Streaming Online: David Warner and Aaron Finch got the chase in their match 
against Afghanistan in Bristol on Saturday off to a great start. Hamid Hassan
was the most impressive Afghan bowler on display early on, but the chase was
always on at well above the required run rate. Aaron Finch (66) holed out in
the deep to Gulbadin Naib in the 17th over, but by then Australia were well on
 course for victory.
